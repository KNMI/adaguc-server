Version 2.0.25 2017-07-28
    - Tilecreation speed is optimized. When optimizeextent is set to true in TileSettings, only the partial area from the big netcdf file is read into memory and used for warping and tilecreation
    - The bottom, left, right and top parameters in TileSettings are now optional, when left out they will be automatically detected based on the input file. This simplifies TileSettings if only one input file is needed as input.
    

Version 2.0.24 2017-07-28
    - Updatedb has a new flag called --recreate. This drops the filetables and will recreate the them
    - Updatedb now synchronizes scanned files with the database per 50 scanned files.

Version 2.0.23 2017-08-01
    - TileSettings has an extra configuration attribute called "optimizeextent" for optimizing reading small chunks from big grids
    - TileSettings debug mode now draw the border of the tiles on the GetMap with lines
    - Nearest neighbour renderer mode can be set to precise or fast with RenderSettings element in Styles

Version 2.0.22 2017-03-27
    - Worked on dockerizing and modularizing 
    - Added extra configuration examples for adaguc workshop 2017
    
Version 2.0.20 2016-11-28
    - CCDFDataModel supports NC_STRING types for attributes

Version 2.0.19 2016-11-20
    - Tiles can now be generated from very big grids in any cartographic projection
    - GeoJSON supports line rendering

Version 2.0.18 2016-11-06
    - Added linear transformation in Nearest neighbour renderer when geographic mappings are equal.
    
Version 2.0.17 2016-10-13
    - Support for POI markers
    
Version 2.0.18 2016-10-12
    - Support for 365_day calendars    
    
Version 2.0.13, 2016-08-15:
    - OpenDAP strings are encoded with two dimensions data(numstrings,maxStrlen64) by the NetCDF library. Internally this is now translated to CDF_STRING
    - Anydump is able to list strings
    - Timeseries/points are now plotted correctly over opendap

Version 2.0.12, 2016-08-10:
    - Added support for NetCDF4 groups
    - Added anydump tool in CCDFDataModel, make with "make anydump"
    - Added initial support for TROPOMI
    - Added 360_day calendar support for CLIPC
    - Bugfix: GetFeatureInfo now works on Byte data
    - Bugfix: Layers with groups can now be served over ADAGUC OpenDAP, group separator is replaced by "_"
    
Version 2.0.9, 2016-07-22:
    - AdditionalLayer functionality now works with NetCDF files with two dimensions per variable (only y,x data).
    - Added datamask datapostprocessor
    - Added include_layer datapostprocessor
    - WCS NetCDFDataWriter now supports multiple dataobjects as output.
    - WMS GetFeatureInfo can now output multiple data objects when they have the same standard name
